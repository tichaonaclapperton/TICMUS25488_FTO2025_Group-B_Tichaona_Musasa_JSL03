# JSL03 Challenge ‚Äì 

## Overview

This project is a simple interactive  JavaScript-based code that **prompt user to enter tasks** and the tasks will have related data stored in an object which is under an array such as (Title, Description, Status). The main purpose of this project is to show the understanding of **user input validation**, **conditional logic**, and **basic output to the console with objects in array**.


## Key Features 

The solution demonstrates how to:

- Prompt the user for **titles**, **descriptions**, and **status**.
- The user must to be able to add up to 3 new tasks in the console to the existing task array so that my board doesn‚Äôt become overloaded with too many tasks.			 
- Validate the entered status to ensure it's one of the allowed options
- Display only tasks with the status "done" logged in the console as an array, with a clear "Completed Tasks" label, so that It can easy to check which tasks have been completed.			
- Display  all tasks logged in the console as an array, with a clear label, so that it's easy to review everything added to the board.			
 

## Structure

The project includes:

- ‚úÖ Interactive JavaScript to collect, store and validate user input.
- üß† Clear loops for input validation
- üîç Simple logic that checks **all task** and **completed tasks** status and store them accordingly


## How to run the code

1. Open the project folder with **Live Server** in VS Code, then open your browser's **developer console** to view the outputs.
2. Compare the tasks and check which one are completed from all the task the you enterd
3. Reflect on any areas where your code could be **cleaner**, **more robust**, or **easier to read**.
