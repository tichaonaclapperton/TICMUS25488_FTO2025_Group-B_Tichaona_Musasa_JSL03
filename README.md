# JSL02 Challenge ‚Äì Solution Code

## Overview

This repository provides the **official solution code for the JSL02 challenge**. It is meant to help students verify their understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, particularly **user input validation**, **conditional logic**, and **basic output to the console**.

Students should use this solution to:

- Review their approach to handling user input via `prompt()`
- Compare logic used for validating task statuses (`todo`, `doing`, `done`)
- Understand how to handle multiple conditional outputs
- Improve their code readability and structure before continuing to **JSL03**

## Features Covered

The solution demonstrates how to:

- Prompt the user for **titles**, **descriptions**, and **status** of two tasks
- Validate the entered status to ensure it's one of the allowed options
- Display a **summary in the console** if a task is marked `"done"`
- Log a motivational message if **neither** task is completed

## Structure

The project includes:

- ‚úÖ Interactive JavaScript to collect and validate user input
- üß† Clear loops for input validation
- üîç Simple logic that checks and logs completion status
- üí¨ Console messages to give meaningful feedback to the user

## How to Use This Solution

1. Open the project folder with **Live Server** in VS Code, then open your browser's **developer console** to view the outputs.
2. Compare the input handling, validation, and logging logic to your own implementation.
3. Reflect on any areas where your code could be **cleaner**, **more robust**, or **easier to read**.
4. Make necessary improvements before continuing to JSL03.
